            <h2>GENESIS OF OUR COLLEGE</h2>
           <p>Before India's independence, Basavakalyan was called Kalyani. After independence and division of states on linguistic basis in 1956, Kalyana was renamed as BasavaKalyan in memory of Vishwaguru Basavanna, a social reformer who established Anubhava Mantapa (spiritual democracy) in 12th-century India. Basavakalyan was ruled by Western Chalukyas, Kalachuris of Kalyani, Yadavas of Devagiri, Kakatiyas, Delhi Sultanate, BahamaniSultanate , Mughals and Hyderabad Nizams. S.S.K. Basaveshwaf Arts, Science, Commerece, UG & PG College, was started in 1967. This Institution is one of the earliest Colleges in Basavakalyan. Over the years it has become one of the prestigious institutions as there has been a consistent infrastructure development with both men and material aiming at imparting quality education. This institution is located on the tank bund of “Tripurant Tank” with a very pleasant atmosphere covering an area of about 4.0 acres.
            A person with an inquisitive mind may start wondering how this reputed Institute has been in a position to carry out this process of learning and teaching effectively, efficiently and always imbibing the cult of pursuing excellence among the teachers and the taught. Our institution gives importance to all-round development of the students. Our college provides special lecture and remedial classes to the slow learners in all the subjects. The institution aims at transforming every student, who passes through its portals towards a progressive society, while at the same time being tempered by social concern, empathy and visionary leadership. The greatest testimonial to the justification of an institution is the contribution of its students to society.
            A thrust area of the college is teaching to acquiring and imparting knowledge, the teachers and students are also aiming to create knowledge through extension activities. Backing the knowledge of the teachers is the library. Over thirty three thousand plus books are at the deck and call of the young scholars. The advanced knowledge being provided here is ably backed by cutting edge facilities - projectors and computers. A student in the campus has endless possibilities of journey through human experience. Recognizing that the real need of every human being is self-actualization, the college offers the scope of self-expression through its Arts, Science &Commerce Academy. The consequence of such outlets of expression is the humanizing of students.</p>
